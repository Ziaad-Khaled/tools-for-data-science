    "### Arithmetic Expression Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions are fundamental in mathematics and programming. They involve performing mathematical operations on numerical values. Here are some examples of common arithmetic expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Addition**: Addition is represented by the `+` symbol. For example:\n",
    "   - `2 + 3` evaluates to `5`.\n",
    "   - `8.5 + 4.2` evaluates to `12.7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subtraction**: Subtraction is represented by the `-` symbol. For example:\n",
    "   - `7 - 4` evaluates to `3`.\n",
    "   - `10.3 - 2.7` evaluates to `7.6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiplication**: Multiplication is represented by the `*` symbol. For example:\n",
    "   - `5 * 6` evaluates to `30`.\n",
    "   - `3.2 * 2.5` evaluates to `8.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Division**: Division is represented by the `/` symbol. For example:\n",
    "   - `10 / 2` evaluates to `5`.\n",
    "   - `15.6 / 3.0` evaluates to `5.2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exponentiation**: Exponentiation is represented by the `**` symbol. For example:\n",
    "   - `2 ** 3` evaluates to `8`.\n",
    "   - `4.0 ** 0.5` evaluates to `2.0`."
